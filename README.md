## Project Overview

This project analyzes a simulated customer churn dataset for MTN Nigeria, reflecting real-world customer behaviors, demographics, and service interactions from Q1 2025. The dataset provides a rich framework for identifying the "who," "what," and "why" behind customer attrition.

This project demonstrates practical experience in data cleaning and transformation (Power Query), advanced data modeling and analysis (DAX), and building intuitive, interactive visualizations (Power BI). The final dashboard translates complex data into a clear story, enabling stakeholders to make informed, data-driven decisions.

## Objectives

The primary aim of this project is to answer critical business questions:

  * **Who** are the customers, and which segments are churning the most?
  * **Where** is churn happening geographically?
  * **When** are customers leaving (at what point in their customer lifetime)?
  * **Why** are customers leaving?
  * **What** is the financial impact of churn on the business?

Other objectives include:

  * Analyze churn distribution by device type, age group, and customer tenure.
  * Identify the top reasons for churn and quantify their impact.
  * Track key performance indicators (KPIs) like Churn Rate, Active Rate, and Revenue Lost.
  * Build a fully interactive dashboard for stakeholders to explore data and uncover insights.

## Data Description

The dataset is a simulation representing 496 unique customers and their attributes.

It contains the following key columns:

  * **Customer ID:** Unique identifier for each customer
  * **State:** Geographic location of the customer
  * **Subscription Plan:** Type of service plan
  * **Customer Tenure in months:** Length of time the customer has been active
  * **Age:** Age of the customer
  * **MTN Device:** Type of device used (e."Mobile SIM Card", "4G Router", etc.)
  * **Satisfaction Rate:** Customer's rating of services (1-5)
  * **Customer Review:** Categorical review ("Poor", "Good", "Excellent", etc.)
  * **Customer Churn Status:** Whether the customer has churned (Yes/No)
  * **Reasons for Churn:** Their reason for leaving (if churned)
  * **Total Revenue:** Total revenue generated by the customer

## Key Features

  * **Executive KPI Cards:** At-a-glance metrics for Total Customers, Total Churned, Active Customers, Total Revenue, and Revenue Lost to Churn, with percentage change indicators.
  * **Interactive Charts:** A combination of bar, line, and area charts visualize the primary churn drivers, churn rate by customer lifetime, and churn by demographic (Age Group) and product (Device Type).
  * **Cross-Filtering:** All visuals on the dashboard are interconnected. Clicking a segment (e.g., "7-12 Months" on the lifetime chart) filters all other visuals to show data *only* for that segment.
  * **Combo Chart Analysis:** A line-and-column chart plots `Total Revenue` against `Churn Rate` for each `Subscription Plan`, instantly identifying high-value, high-risk plans.
  * **Dynamic Slicers:** Top-level slicers for `Gender` and `State` allow for high-level filtering of the entire report.

## Dashboard Preview

## Tools and Technologies

  * **Microsoft Power BI:** The primary tool used for data analysis and visualization.
  * **Power Query:** Used for all data cleaning, transformation, and creation of conditional columns (e.g., Age Groups, Customer Lifetime Bins).
  * **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions):** Used to create all key measures and KPIs, including `Total Customer`, `Total churned`, `[%Churn rate]`, and `[Revenue Lost to Churn]`.

## Insights

The dashboard analysis reveals a clear story about customer attrition:

  * **The Financial Impact is Severe:** The company has a **29.4% churn rate**, which has resulted in a direct **revenue loss of ₦58 million** from a total of ₦199.3M in revenue. This means churned customers account for **29.09% of all revenue**, indicating we are losing high-value customers.

  * **Why They Leave - Competition & Price:** The top reason for churn is **"Better Offers from Competitors"** (29 customers). This is immediately followed by internal factors: **"High Call Tariffs"** (26 customers) and **"Costly Data Plans" (20 customers)**. This shows churn is driven by aggressive pricing and competitive pressure, not just network quality.

  * **When They Leave - The 7-12 Month "Danger Zone":** Churn is not linear. It is lowest for new customers (23.8% for \< 6 months) but **spikes to 33.3%** for customers in the **7-12 month tenure bracket**. If we can retain customers past the one-year mark, their churn rate begins to fall.

  * **Who is Leaving - The Youth Segment:** The **"\< 18 yrs" age group has an alarming 50.0% churn rate**, the highest by a significant margin. The "18-35 yrs" group follows at 32.0%. We are failing to retain our younger demographic.

  * **The Satisfaction Anomaly:** Counter-intuitively, customers who gave an **"Excellent" (5-star) review have the highest churn rate at 36.0%**. This is higher than those who rated the service "Poor" (26.5%). This suggests that **satisfaction does not guarantee loyalty** and that our most "satisfied" customers are being successfully poached by competitors.

## Key Learnings

  * **Price and competition are the primary churn drivers.** Our value proposition is being successfully challenged.
  * **The first year is the most critical retention period.** We have a specific "danger zone" between 7-12 months where customers are most likely to leave.
  * **The youth market is a major blind spot.** A 50% churn rate for the \<18 segment is unsustainable and represents a massive loss of future customer lifetime value.
  * **Satisfaction scores are not a reliable predictor of loyalty.** We must look deeper than customer reviews to identify at-risk customers, as our "best" customers are leaving.

## Recommendations

1.  **Launch a Competitive Pricing Strategy:** Directly combat the \#1 churn reason ("Better Offers") by launching a targeted campaign. This could include price-matching guarantees for call tariffs or data bonuses for customers who cite competitor offers.

2.  **Redesign the First-Year Journey:** To address the 7-12 month churn spike, implement a proactive loyalty program. Offer milestone rewards at the 6- and 9-month marks (e.g., a free data day, a streaming voucher) to reinforce value *before* they consider leaving.

3.  **Develop a Youth-Centric Product:** The 50% churn rate in the \<18 segment requires an immediate, tailored solution. This segment should be targeted with a "youth-only" plan that offers benefits like data-free social media/gaming and flexible "sachet" data bundles.

4.  **Investigate the "Excellent" Churn Anomaly:** The Customer Experience (CX) team must immediately conduct qualitative follow-up surveys with churned customers who left "Excellent" reviews. We must find the specific "tipping point" that caused our happiest customers to leave.

## Conclusion

This analysis proves that customer churn at MTN is a ₦58M problem driven by specific, actionable factors. We are losing a price-sensitive youth market and even our most "satisfied" customers to aggressive competitors.

By using the insights from this dashboard, management can move from a reactive to a proactive retention strategy, focusing resources on competitive pricing, first-year loyalty, and youth-focused products to protect revenue and build a more loyal customer base.
